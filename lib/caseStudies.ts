    approach:
      "We started by auditing every channel the client was using—paid search, paid social, email, and display—to understand where data lived and how it was being reported. From there, we designed a unified tracking plan and stitched data together into a single warehouse so every impression, click and conversion was aligned to the same customer and campaign model. On top of this, we built an AI-powered dashboard that highlighted under- and over-performing segments, surfaced budget-reallocation suggestions, and allowed the marketing team to simulate ‘what-if’ scenarios before changing spend.",

We then introduced a set of automation scripts and workflow rules that pulled orders directly from their CRM, validated them against inventory and pricing policies, and pushed clean data into the existing ERP system. Human review was reserved only for exceptions, with a clear dashboard that showed bottlenecks, error trends, and where further automation would have the most impact.",

Next, we engineered a resilient scraping infrastructure using rotating proxies, headless browsers, and site-specific adapters to cope with changing layouts and anti-bot protections. The raw data was normalised into a consistent schema and loaded into a central warehouse, where we added automated quality checks and alerting so the team could instantly see when competitors changed prices or launched new SKUs.",

Based on that discovery, we modelled a shared set of definitions—what a lead, opportunity, active user or churned customer actually meant—and implemented them inside a modern data stack. Finally, we built interactive dashboards with drill-downs, cohort views and alerting, so leaders could jump from high-level KPIs into the underlying drivers in just a few clicks, without waiting for an analyst to run custom reports.",

We also optimised performance with image optimisation, caching and edge delivery, and wired in behavioural analytics to continuously test variations of landing pages, forms and calls-to-action.",

Motion graphics, on-screen annotations and subtle sound design were layered in to highlight important moments, while different cuts were produced for social, landing pages and webinar follow-ups.",

All automations were rolled out with careful safeguards—easy human takeover, clear labelling and analytics—so the support leadership could monitor impact, refine flows and gradually expand the range of tasks handled by AI.",

  resultsImage: "/case-studies/watchdog_result.png",

  problem:
    "The growth team was spending hours every week manually checking the Meta Ad Library to see what competitors were running. Screenshots lived in random Notion pages and Slack threads, there was no historical view of how creatives evolved over time, and nobody could confidently answer simple questions like: \"Which competitors are increasing spend right now?\" or \"Which hooks and formats are being tested most often?\" As a result, creative strategy was driven more by intuition than by a consistent, data-backed view of the competitive landscape.",

  approach:
    "We started by working with the team to define a practical scope for monitoring: a curated list of priority competitors, target markets, and product lines. From there, we configured our Facebook Competitor Watchdog (Facebook Analyzer) to continuously crawl the Meta Ad Library for those brands, normalising all retrieved ads into a clean structure with fields like objective, placement, format, language, and creative angle.\n\n" +
    "Next, we built an opinionated tagging system that grouped creatives by hook (price vs. social proof vs. urgency), format (UGC, static, carousel, etc.) and funnel stage. This allowed the marketing team to go from a messy grid of random ads to focused views such as \"new UGC creatives launched this week\" or \"best-performing offer framings over the last 30 days\". Historical snapshots were stored so they could scroll back in time and see how messaging evolved ahead of big launches or seasonal pushes.\n\n" +
    "On top of the data layer, we shipped a lightweight dashboard and alerting layer. Stakeholders could log into a simple web UI, filter by competitor or theme, and immediately see top creatives, frequency of new launches, and shifts in messaging. Weekly email digests summarised key changes—new angles, unusually high creative volume from a competitor, or sudden pivots in offer strategy—so the team didn’t have to remember to \"check the tool\" every day. All of this plugged directly into their existing creative briefing process, turning the Facebook Analyzer into a starting point for every new batch of ad concepts.",

  results:
    "Within the first quarter, the team replaced ad-hoc competitor spying with a single, trusted source of truth for Facebook ad intelligence. Time spent on manual research dropped by roughly 80%, freeing strategists to focus on ideation instead of screenshots and spreadsheets.\n\n" +
    "More importantly, creative testing became significantly sharper. By systematically borrowing proven hooks and formats—and intentionally counter-positioning against weak competitor angles—they increased win rate on new creative tests and saw a ~25–30% lift in blended ROAS on campaigns influenced by insights from the Watchdog dashboard. The team also used historical data to catch early signs of competitor pushes (e.g., heavy discounting or new product launches) and adjust budgets and messaging before performance dipped, turning the Facebook Analyzer into an ongoing early-warning system rather than a one-off audit.",

Then we migrated the store to a modern headless commerce stack, introducing a cleaner navigation, faster product search and a simplified, mobile-optimised checkout. Behind the scenes we integrated analytics, CRM and email automation so browsing behaviour, cart events and purchases automatically triggered relevant flows like abandoned-cart nudges, win-back campaigns and personalised recommendations.",

The environment was then rebuilt on a more reliable, scalable platform with enforced SPF, DKIM and DMARC, plus clear mailbox policies and admin controls for onboarding and off-boarding staff. Finally, we implemented monitoring and deliverability reporting so IT and leadership could see, in real time, how reliably messages were reaching client inboxes and where further tuning was needed.",
